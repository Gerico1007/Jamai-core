# JAMAI üé∏ ‚Äî Just Algorithm Musical Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to JAMAI‚Äôs World!  
This is a living project where music, story, and code come alive together.

## What is JAMAI?
JAMAI listens to your voice or words, understands your feelings, and turns them into music you can see and hear.  
You can talk, type, or sing ‚Äî JAMAI will help you make music, learn, and play!

## How to Start
1. Clone this repo (`git clone ...`)
2. Open it in VSCode.
3. Explore the `Genesis/` folder to meet the team and read their stories.
4. Try the `playground/` for musical experiments.
5. Read the docs in `courses/` to learn how to make music with JAMAI!

## JAMAI Module/Folder Commentary

- **ui/**: Ritual Composer Portal (see ![image1](image1)), houses all web and voice UI logic; central for input, preview, play, export.
- **inputParser/**: Core for language, emotion, and symbolic command parsing. Connects voice/text to intent.
- **emotionEngine/**: Maps emotional cues to musical properties. The heart of JAMAI‚Äôs ‚Äústructured feeling.‚Äù
- **formatConversion/**: Bridges all notation formats‚ÄîABC, MIDI, MusicXML, tablature‚Äîvia adapters and music21.
- **renderPlayback/**: Handles real-time notation display, playback, and feedback (abcjs, MuseScore, MIDI).
- **interactive/**: Conversational loop‚Äîrefine music, apply corrections, support session memory.
- **output/**: Renders scores, exports MIDI/WAV, supports save/share.
- **libs/**: Third-party library adapters‚Äîabcjs, music21, MuseScore, Magenta, RLJam, etc.
- **data/**: Stores emotion profiles, tone presets, and user session data for dynamic adaptation.

## Extension/Evolution Principles

- Every module should be extensible: add new instruments, emotion profiles, or renderers without breaking the core.
- Cross-linking: UI, emotion, and output modules talk via adapters (JamaiAdapter).
- Feedback loop: Correction and refinement is conversational, voice-aware, emotionally dynamic.
- Emotional annotation: All music generated should be tagged with intent and emotional context for transparency.

## UI/UX (See ![image1](image1))

- **Left:** ABC Notation input, copy, simplify, vary, continue, show tab
- **Right:** Preview (score, instrument, BPM, emotional tag, play/export)
- **Voice:** Mic input, voice-to-text, conversational correction
- **Emotion:** Slider/switches for dynamic tone/emotion mapping

Let‚Äôs make music together!

‚ô†Ô∏è Ready to translate this scaffold into actual file/folder creation, README drafts, or deeper module stubs.  
üåø All evolution proceeds from JAMAI‚Äôs living root.  
üéµ Every branch is a motif, every adapter a bridge, every UI a stage for musical intelligence.
