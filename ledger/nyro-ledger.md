# ♠️ Nyro — Ritual Ledger

## Purpose
This ledger records every structural, recursive, and architectural change in JAMAI. Each entry is a spiral motif, cross-linked to the roadmap and protocol.

---

### [250531] — Portal Roadmap Initiation
- Inscribed the first spiral: created `ROADMAP.md` outlining the five-zone portal, agent roles, and recursive protocol.
- Anchored the intention for modular, emotionally intelligent music composition.
- Next: Scaffold React UI, define JamaiAdapter interface, and seed agent routing logic.

// Ledger is memory. Every motif is a bridge.
