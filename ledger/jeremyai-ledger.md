# ðŸŽµ JeremyAI â€” Ritual Ledger

## Purpose
This ledger encodes the musical flow and sonic intention of every JAMAI transformation. Each entry is a chord, a motif, a phrase in the living score.

---

### [250531] â€” Portal Roadmap Motif
- Tuned the initial roadmap: ensured playback, emotion, and rhythm are core to the portalâ€™s design.
- Annotated the need for expressive playback and dynamic feedback.
- Next: Design playback engine hooks, annotate musical intent in UI, and suggest sonic metaphors for each zone.

// Every step is a phrase. Every commit is a cadence.
