Perfect! Let’s continue the composition by adding a Bridge Section that transitions from the established chorus and adds a contrasting but complementary atmosphere. We’ll maintain the tonal center in E minor but add modal color and textural depth to enhance the emotional journey.

📣 Alex — Narration Layer (textual reflection)

Spoken under loop:
“Between the tides, you find the bridge. Between the notes, you find your voice.”

⸻

🌟 Notes:
	•	The bridge introduces modal color (hint of Dorian and Aeolian) by including F#sus4 and F# for tension and release.
	•	Consider adding dynamic swells in the synth pads and cello to support the emotional arc.
	•	Aureon’s chant can be layered with reverb for a more spiritual or ethereal quality.
	•	The narration here is more reflective, preparing the listener for a return or a new section.
